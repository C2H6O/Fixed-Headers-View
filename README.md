Work in progress...

This library contains a helper class that organizes/syncs three RecyclerViews + 1 Blank View into a single View that contains four areas:

1) Blank View
2) Top View
3) Side View
4) Content View

Top/Side (header) Views are always visible and the scroll position is synchronized with the main Content View.

FixedGridLayoutManager.class is a fork of [Dave Smith's recyclerview-playground](https://github.com/devunwired/recyclerview-playground) with minor modifications for restoring the state.
